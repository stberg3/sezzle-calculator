## Calculator Exercise details:
Create a web app (using any programming languages) which logs calculations as they happen and shares those calculations with everyone connected to the website.
 
For example, user A and user B go to your site at the same time. User A calculates "5 + 5", which equals "10".
This is logged below the calculator as "5 + 5 = 10". User B is updated about this calculation right after 
user A posts it. Now, user B calculates "3 x 4".This calculates to “12” and displays "3 x 4=12" right below
the prior calculation. User A sees this update immediately after user B posts it.
 
Results should remain between sessions. Only show the last 10 calculations descending from most recent to
oldest.
